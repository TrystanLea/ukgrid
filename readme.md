This tool shows realtime uk electricity demand and how it is supplied from different sources of electricity generation. The data is updated every 5 minutes from bmreports.com.

The small and fast timeseries database is called PHPFina and is an adaptation of the feed engine used in [emoncms](http://github.com/emoncms/emoncms).
